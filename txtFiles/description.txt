Using aspHide
- python main.py  :main.py is the index file for the program.
- Selecting file process automatically detects the selected file type and accepts only jpg or jpeg file and changes directory if dir is selected.
- [END] is used as escape sequence that detects the end of message. So, don't type [END] in message.
- Once the message is hidden into image, you will be redirected to main menu and image saved directory will be shown. (~/)
- Once the message is extracted from the image, the message is displayed in the terminal and asks for input.
- r! -> to write the text to a file in ~/ dir
